### This app will post a logo of either Nike or Adidas onto the shirt of a user.

In order for companies to connect with consumers they need to make them feel as though they are engaged with the 
brand. Technology allows us to do this by providing a filter that displays what a consumer can look like with a 
certain brand apparel attached to it. 

### How to use

Tracking.js is an amazing library, but like all forms of facial recognition, it only works when
its used with an effective camera. This app works best in a well lite area, with a camera from a smartphone. 
Simply click on the experience (brand) you to want see. The image should appear on your chest.

### Face tracking 

This app does not save face data. Rather the face tracking library (tracking.js) simply detects a face and uses a 
hard coded value (created by me), which determines where the logo will show up. Most applications that provide filters utilize 
few buttons and inputs. I only created a button to allow the user to select the experience they would want.
